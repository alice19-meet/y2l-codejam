## Question 1 
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Question 2
The series, ![Question 2.1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1%5E%7B1%7D%20&plus;%202%5E%7B2%7D%20&plus;%203%5E%7B3%7D%20&plus;%20...%20&plus;%2010%5E%7B10%7D%20%3D%2010405071317.)

Find the last ten digits of the series, ![Question 2.2](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1%5E%7B1%7D%20&plus;%202%5E%7B2%7D%20&plus;%203%5E%7B3%7D%20&plus;%20...%20&plus;%201000%5E%7B1000%7D%20.)

## Question 3
The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:

41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13

This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.
The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.
Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?

## Question 4
Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of numbers less than n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.

It can be seen that n=6 produces a maximum n/φ(n) for n ≤ 10.

Find the value of n ≤ 1,000,000 for which n/φ(n) is a maximum.

## Question 5
In the 5 by 5 matrix below, the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right, by only moving to the right and down, is indicated in bold red and is equal to 2427.
