## Question 1 
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Question 2
The series, ![Question 2.1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1%5E%7B1%7D%20&plus;%202%5E%7B2%7D%20&plus;%203%5E%7B3%7D%20&plus;%20...%20&plus;%2010%5E%7B10%7D%20%3D%2010405071317.)

Find the last ten digits of the series, ![Question 2.2](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1%5E%7B1%7D%20&plus;%202%5E%7B2%7D%20&plus;%203%5E%7B3%7D%20&plus;%20...%20&plus;%201000%5E%7B1000%7D%20.)

## Question 3
The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:

41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13

This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.
The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.
Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?

## Question 4
Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of numbers less than n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.

![Question 4](https://ibb.co/pykdzty)

It can be seen that n=6 produces a maximum n/φ(n) for n ≤ 10.

Find the value of n ≤ 1,000,000 for which n/φ(n) is a maximum.
